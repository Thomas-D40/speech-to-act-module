# Example 3: Compatible but Distinct Concepts

## Input
Gabriel ate everything and was happy

## Expected Behavior
TWO separate CanonicalFacts should be emitted.
Mood and eating can co-occur but should be separate facts unless causally linked.

## Expected Output
Tool Call 1:
{
  "subjects": ["Gabriel"],
  "dimension": "MEAL_MAIN_CONSUMPTION",
  "value": "ALL",
  "confidence": 0.95
}

Tool Call 2:
{
  "subjects": ["Gabriel"],
  "dimension": "CHILD_MOOD",
  "value": "HAPPY",
  "confidence": 0.9
}

## Compatibility Rule Applied
[COMPATIBLE_BUT_SEPARATE] Mood and eating can co-occur but should be separate facts unless causally linked.
