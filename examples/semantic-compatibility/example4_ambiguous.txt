# Example 4: Ambiguous Utterance

## Input
He did everything

## Expected Behavior
NO dimension can be confidently inferred because "did" is too generic.
The LLM should either refuse extraction or return very low confidence (< 0.5).

## Expected Output
No tool calls OR very low confidence response explaining the ambiguity.

## Compatibility Rule Applied
[AMBIGUOUS_DIMENSION] The verb 'did' is too generic to infer a specific dimension without additional context. Refuse extraction or set confidence below 0.5.
