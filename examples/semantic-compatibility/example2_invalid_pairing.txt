# Example 2: Invalid Semantic Pairing

## Input
Gabriel slept everything

## Expected Behavior
NO valid CanonicalFact can be formed because "slept" cannot logically combine with consumption dimensions.
The LLM should refuse extraction or return very low confidence (< 0.3).

## Expected Output
No tool calls OR:
{
  "subjects": ["Gabriel"],
  "dimension": "SLEEP_STATE",
  "value": "ASLEEP",
  "confidence": 0.2
}
(Note: The "everything" part should be ignored as semantically nonsensical with "slept")

## Compatibility Rule Applied
[SEMANTIC_NONSENSE] Sleep-related verbs (slept, sleeping, nap) cannot logically combine with consumption dimensions.
