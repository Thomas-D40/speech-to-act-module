# Example 1: Incompatible Dimensions (must split)

## Input
Gabriel ate everything and slept

## Expected Behavior
TWO separate CanonicalFacts should be emitted because eating and sleeping are semantically distinct activities.

## Expected Output
Tool Call 1:
{
  "subjects": ["Gabriel"],
  "dimension": "MEAL_MAIN_CONSUMPTION",
  "value": "ALL",
  "confidence": 0.95
}

Tool Call 2:
{
  "subjects": ["Gabriel"],
  "dimension": "SLEEP_STATE",
  "value": "ASLEEP",
  "confidence": 0.9
}

## Compatibility Rule Applied
[MUST_SPLIT] Eating and sleeping are semantically distinct activities that must be recorded as separate facts.
